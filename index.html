  <p> Hello. My name is Ryan, and I am a junior at NJIT. I recently switched from majoring in computer science to majoring in information technology. I feel that IT as a whole will be a better fit for me career-wise. Information technology isn’t just about software like computer science which I enjoy. IT has a little bit of everything which makes it easier to not burn out from doing the same task. In the future, I hope to get a job that challenges me in a way that I must grow.  </p>

    Regarding my hobbies and interests, I spend a lot of my free time watching TV shows or playing video games. However, when school is not in session, I tend to hang out with my friends more. Another hobby I have is cooking/ baking, whether that be watching cooking shows or actually baking. I also enjoy going on vacation to different countries. I’m actually planning a trip to Japan in the near future.
